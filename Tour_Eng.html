                Man Hyu-jeong Pavilion was built by Kim Gye-haeng of Bobaekdang. The current building has been repaired several times.
                Although it was modified, some of it shows the style of the late Joseon Dynasty. Three-sided open numaru at the front
                It is opened in a form to allow visitors to enjoy the natural scenery. On the 3rd side of the pavilion, a field railing is installed.
                It is installed. The front side is open and consists of a wooden floor with a single roof.
                The octagonal roof has a very sharp eaves and a sharp waist, which accentuates the taste of the pavilion.
